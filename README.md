# Approximate-Integrals
Extra Credit Project for Calculus Based Calculus II. See README.md for more info.

The many calculations for the project were meant to be done by hand, so I hacked this 
together to save hours of time.

Allowes a user to enter an integral and then:
  -Calculates the intergral's true value.
  
  -Compares it to the result you would get when using the Midpoint Rule (Rectangle Method).
  
  -Compares it to the result you would get when using the Trapezoidal Rule.

The program requires SciPy, NumPy, and PrettyTable.
